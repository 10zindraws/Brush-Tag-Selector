This Krita docker plugin displays all your tags in an array of buttons, allowing you to switch tags faster than the default method of going in Brush Preset's dropdown menu <br>

**Note** This is a fork of general-avalanche-43's plugin, the change being that the plugin now automatically recognizes your tags and when tags are added or removed. Before it required you to type all your tags in a .txt file
